PythonHW
HI This is the python HW Pybank has only the main.py and output as defined by the homework requirments. 
Pypoll has main.py and output to be graded, as defined by the homework requirements. 
  The other, main1.py was done as an alternative to getting the python class to work, and maindevelopment has all the debugging that was done before the clean up for submittal. (So not for grading purposes) 
  
  Thank you CJ
